The differences between MIPS and a high level language are as below:

As one can see , in C++ , we are not allocating space for the string , nor making any
space on the stack . The string size allocation and space is handled by the language and 
its compiler itself.
However , writing the same in MIPS requires us to allocate space on the stack pointer and
making space for the same . 

In C/C++ , the approach followed is a top down approach ,however MIPS has the freedom for
both approaches , i.e, Top down or bottom up . Both the approaches are equally convenient.

Our approach in MIPS has been via memoisation , however for C++ , it is a simple recursion
.

The concerned assignment was written in MIPS . Below is the code for the same in a higher
level language (C++).
~~~~~~~~~
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

string fib(int n)
{
	if(n==0)
		return "0";
	if(n==1)
		return "01";
	else
	{
		return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2);
	}
}
int main()
{
	int n;
	cout<<"Enter the value of n: ";
	cin>>n;
	cout<<"The corresponding string is: ";
	cout<<fib(n);
	return 0;
}
